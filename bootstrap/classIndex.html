            Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web
            pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply
            Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether
            the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides
            basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form
            elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap
            to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and
            dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

            Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery.
            They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation
            drop-downs, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in
            some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface
            elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.

            The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The
            basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers
            can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the
            width with the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of
            the screen showing the page:[citation needed]
